# nvim-lint

A asynchronous linter plugin for Neovim (>= 0.5) complementary to the
built-in Language Server Protocol support.

It uses the same API to populate the diagnostic as the language server client
built-in to neovim would do. Any customizations you did for
`vim.lsp.diagnostic` apply for this plugin as well.


## MVP

- [ ] Write the rest of the readme
- [ ] Finalize linter interface
- [ ] Include some linters for languages with a lack of good language servers
